A universal selector is used to style every element on a page; A element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type; A class selector is used to select elements that serve the same function while also can be used for styling; and an ID selector defines style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. You might choose one over the other depending on if a rule should be applied to many elements or if a rule should be applied to only one or a few elements.

I chose my color palette based off Vincent Van Gogh's Starry Night painting which happens to be my favorite painting of all time. Not only do I love the painting itself, but also one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard is also called Starry Night and it's a song written about Vincent Van Gogh and his struggles. I have also gotten the chance to go to one fo the Van Gogh immersive exhibits which was so cool and made me love his work even more.
