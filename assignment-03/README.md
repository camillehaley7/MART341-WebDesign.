In this class, I have learned that websites require .html because they contain visible content of that site and HTML is the standard language used to create web pages. I have learned that README files are text files that contain information about their directory and how to create a README. Finally, I have learned that the internet connects participants while the web connects informations, and combining the internet and the web is what makes up world wide web.
